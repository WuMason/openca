OpenCA PKCS#7 Tool
==================

0. General Info
===============

You can find three programs in this distro: sign, verify, sv. The first signs
given data, adds to the signature a time, the siger's certificate and, if
wanted, the data (not encrypted). The verify tool simply verifies a given
signature (and data).

The last tool, sv, is a new tool allowing for singnature generation/verification
(in fact is derived from the other two) and for signature transformation from
detached to non-detached (data will be included in the signature itself). When
usinf this tool parameters you have to pass are exactly the same as the ones
reported below for the sign/verify part.

1. Installation
===============

To install the tool simply do the following (to get some options just do
'./configure --help' ):

	$ ./configure
	$ make clean
	$ make

then became root (to be sure having write privileges to dest directory) and
type:

	# make install
