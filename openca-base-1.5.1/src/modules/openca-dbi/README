INSTALLATION
------------

* install with support for DBI and DBIS
* change the settings of DBI.conf
  (Please change only the neccessary parts of the
   variables which start with "remote", the other
   variables are still not used or only in an early
   testphase. If you want to know more please use
   "man OpenCA::DBI".)
* the update of the man-page is still a ToDo
  (official deadline for the updated manpage is
  2001-Jul-15)

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

mysql
-----
Please don't use MySQL in a realworld-PKI. This database
is deprecated because it doesn't support the ACID-features
actually and I have no chance to grant the integrity
of your PKI-DB.

A tomicity
C onsistency
I solation
D urability

postgresql
----------
Be shure that YOU set a password!

You can test this with nessus (http://www.nessus.org).

This was and is the most common error of us (some
anonymous people of the staff of the datacenter of
the Humboldt-University of Berlin ;-D).

db2
---
If you get the error "The total environment is not set ..."
Please read the CAVEATS-file like recommended by
IBM. If this not help then you must do the following:

$HOME is the home of the db2-instance

cp $HOME/sqllib/db2profile $HOME_OF_HTTPD_USER/

vi /etc/init.d/apache (or where ever your apache-
startupscript is placed)
> . $HOME_OF_HTTPD_USER/db2profile

vi /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
go to the position of your virtual host or 
otherwise enter it in the right global context
>PassEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
>PassEnv PATH
>PassEnv LIBPATH
>PassEnv CLASSPATH
>PassEnv DB2INSTANCE
>PassEnv DB2DIR
>PassEnv INSTHOME

Perhaps you don't need some of the environmentvariables
but my installation works with this environment and
this should only be a point where you can start ;-D
