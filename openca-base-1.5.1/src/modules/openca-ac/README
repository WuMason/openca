INTRODUCTION
============

   This software is a Perl5 module that helps in managing config
   files: it gives you functions capable of retieving files, stripping
   comments and blank lines, parsing function, ecc...
   
REQUIREMENTS
============

   Any system running Perl5 ( nearly every know! ) there is no specific
   platform code ( at least it should ).

INSTALLATION
============

   After extracting the archive, simply type the following:

      $ perl Makefile.PL

   You will be prompted with a few questions, after initialization
   the installation will proceed with creating needed directories and
   copying module files (you probably need to become root first).

EXAMPLES
========

   In the example directory there are some exaples, please take a look
   at them for simple module usage or refer to documentation in the
   docs directory.

FEEDBACK
========

   This is a very early pre-release, anyway it works fine and it's
   quite usefull yet, so here it comes. Many things should be added
   in the near future, so stay tuned for future releases.

TO DO
=====

   This TODO list is constantly updated, please refer to the last
   version:

      * Nothing at the moment.
