# PKI Resource Query Protocol (PRQP)
# ==================================
#
# PRQP is a new PKIX protocol to provide dynamic approach to PKI service
# configuration. It allows a PRQP server to provide pointers for different
# services (eg., OCSP server, CRL, HTTP request, HTTP revoke, SCEP gateway,
# etc.).
# 
# For more information on what PRQP is and what it can do, please refer to
# the IETF page:
#
#     http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pkix-prqp-04
#
# To download the PRQP server software, please follow the instructions
# on our OpenCA PRQPD project's page at:
#
#     http://www.openca.org/projects/prqpd/

# This goes against PKIX guidelines but some CAs do it and some software
# requires this to avoid interpreting an end user certificate as a CA.

# Here are some examples of the usage of nsCertType. If it is omitted
# the certificate can be used for anything *except* object signing.

# For an object signing certificate this would be used.
#nsCertType = objsign

# For normal client use this is typical
# nsCertType = client, server

# This is typical also
