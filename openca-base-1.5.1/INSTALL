General Info
============

  This document describes how to quickly install the software provided
  with this package, if you are not at ease with the project structure
  please refer to the OpenCA-guide in docs/.

  Also, please follow the main website OpenCA Labs and the OpenCA PKI
  project:

Prerequisites
=============

  Prerequisites for building the OpenCA software are:

  o GNU tar (a tar that understands the z option for gzip)
  o GNU make (at minimum for FreeBSD because there are several problems
    reported with the OS's own make)

  Prerequisites for running the OpenCA software are:

  o OpenSSL (0.9.7+) and devel pacakges (on both CA and external server);
  o Perl (5.6.1+ with DBI support) (on both CA and external server);
  o Berkeley DB and devel packages (libdb-dev or db4-devel)
  o DBI Perl Support (on both CA and external server);
  o Apache Web Server (on both CA and external server);
  o mod_ssl (for Apache) (on external server only);
  o OpenLDAP (v2 is recommended) (on external server) - optional;

     Version 1.0.0+ of OpenSSL exports different interfaces than 0.9.x 
     versions, therefore some PERL packages had to be patched in OpenCA.
     Please do not try to update packages like IO::SSL as the ufficial
     distribution *would not work with new OpenSSL versions*.
  |                                                                        |
  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  OpenCA Tools:

  You also have to install the openca-tools package before installing the base
  openca one. Please download and install the openca-tools package now if you
  still have to do it :-D

  Database Support:

  Since version 0.9.x we switched to a DBI-only database support. Therefore,
  in order to be able to use a database for your system, you should install
  the required packages (and devel packages as well). For example, on CentOS
  and/or Fedora/RedHat, you should install the following packages:

  o To enable MySQL support:
    - mysql
    - mysql-devel
    - perl-DBD-MySQL

  o To enable PostgreSQL support:
    - postgresql
    - postgresql-libs
    - postgresql-devel
    - perl-DBD-Pg

  On other systems, names of required packages might vary, please use the
  system's package management to figure out dependencies and packages names.
  For example, on Ubuntu for MySQL support you might try to add:

    libmysqlclient-dev

  via the 'apt-get' tool.


Quick Install
=============

  The easiest way to proceed is to type:

	$ ./configure --help
	$ make help

  and take a look at the available targets. Continue reading, anyway
  (expecially if you find any difficulties installing the software).


  +--- NOTICE: ------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                                        |
     Before starting, you need to install at least the OpenSSL package
     you can find at <http://www.openssl.org>. Typically you will install
     the OpenSSL package in /usr/local/ssl (by choosing the default dir
     you'll get most of the software configuration already done).
  |                                                                        |
  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  An example usage is as follows:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/openca-1.3 \
       --with-web-host=www.openca.org \
       --with-httpd-fs-prefix=/var/www/WebSites/Default \
       --with-htdocs-fs-prefix=/var/www/WebSites/Default/htdocs

  If you want to install a usable CA, you also need a web server on the
  CA machine to access CA services; another web server (ssl with client
  authentication on suggested) is needed on the external server machine
  carrying the RA and public servers to let the RAs access certificates
  related and directory services.

  You can install all you need for the CA and the external server by using
  the install-ca and install-ext make targets:

	$ tar xvfz openca-$(VER).tar.gz 
	$ cd openca-$(VER)
	$ ./configure --your-options
	$ make

  for a CA system:

	$ make install-offline

  for an RA/Pub interface:

	$ make install-online

  if you need an help about the available targets, use the following:

	$ make help

  (Note: Please set the options for configure carefully. You can find
         some examples in configs/.)


  NOTE:

  If you want more up-to-date modules, you can search the PERL repository
  at http://www.CPAN.org or take a look at httpd://www.openca.org.

    The verify/sign tool is NOT included in the modules directory. It does
    compile fine on Linux and Solaris ( with gcc ). You can install by hand
    (simply unpacking the package openca-tools and follow the INSTALL 
    instruction contained in the main directory).
  |                                                                        |
  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  Please take care that this version requires OpenSSL 0.9.7+ and should
  compile on Linux with gcc (glibc2.1+) and Solaris 8+ with gcc, if you
  can compile it under other platforms, please report patches to
  openca-devel@openca.org or openca-users@lists.sf.net so as to include
  support for it.


Configuring the Package
=======================

  All servers have configuration files in OPENCA_PREFIX/etc

  Before being able to use the OpenCA package you have to finish the
  configuration. You should edit the following file:

	OPENCA_PREFIX/etc/config.xml

  then to propagate the configuration options on all the openca config
  files, you should use the configure_etc.sh script as follows:

	$ cd OPENCA_PREFIX/etc
	$ ./configure_etc.sh

  then to start and stop the openca daemon, you should use the openca_rc
  script:

	$ OPENCA_PREFIX/etc/init.d/openca start

  and to stop OpenCA daemon you should:

	$ OPENCA_PREFIX/etc/init.d/openca stop


  +--- NOTICE: ------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                                                        |
    In order to have the daemon integrated into the system initialization   
    you should look at the documentation from your system. Anyway a simple  
    step to take could be providing a symlink in the /etc/init.d directory, 
    for example:                                                            
                                                                            
       $ cd /etc/init.d                                                     
       $ ln -s OPENCA_PREFIX/etc/init.d/openca openca                
                                                                            
    now you can start/stop/restart the OpenCA Daemon by doing:              
                                                                            
       $ /etc/init.d/openca [ start | stop | restart ]                      
  |                                                                        |
  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Final Steps:
============

  The required final step is to setup a new (empty) database for OpenCA
  needs to store all its data into the database.

  In order to create the Initial Database you should refer to the documentation
  from the DBMS provider. For example if you have postgres installed you
  should be able to create a user by doing the following (from root account):

	# su - postgres
	$ psql template1
	> CREATE USER ...

  then you should create the DATABASE by using credentials now created:

	# psql -U <user> -W template1
	> CREATE DATABASE ...

  now you should be able to access the webserver (remember to configure the
  webserver).

     Check the contrib/ directory for help in configuration of Apache or    
     OpenLDAP servers                                                       
  |                                                                        |
  +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  For MySQL databases, the creation of the database and the user is really
  simple. As reported on the WiKi (http://www.openca.org/wiki):

  $ sudo bash
  # mysql -h localhost
  mysql> CREATE database openca;
  mysql> use openca;
  mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'openca'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY
         'PASSWORD';

  Here we assumed that the database you will be using with openca is called
  'openca', and the same goes for the username. Please remember to put a
  strong password instead of 'PASSWORD'. Also, this will work if the DBMS is
  installed in the same machine where the OpenCA is running. If you want to
  grant privileges for network-connected system, you might want to change
  the GRANT ALL... operation (check the MySQL manual for that)

  From all the OpenCA Labs, thanks for downloading and installing OpenCA, and
  for helping us to ever improve this wonderful product!

  Enjoy OpenCA!
