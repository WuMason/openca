OpenCA Project Overview:
========================

       The OpenCA Project is a  collaborative effort to  develop  a robust,
       full featured and Open Source out-of-the-box Certification Authority
       implementing the most used protocols with full-strength cryptography
       world-wide. OpenCA is based on many Open Source Projects.  Among the
       supported software is OpenLDAP, OpenSSL, Apache Project, mod_ssl.

       The project development is  divided in  two main tasks: studying and
       refining  the security  scheme that guarantees  the best model to be
       used in a  CA and developing  software to easily  setup and manage a
       Certification Authority.
