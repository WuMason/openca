Apache Example Config Notes:
============================

The servers should be divided like this:

	o CA ( actually the democa server) onto the Netwoking-less
	  machine (the most security critical machine);

	o RAServer (raserver) and Secure (secure) servers onto the
	  Network-Connected machine;

There are some different example files in this directory. Let's examine
in more detail.

The apache startup files (actually tested on a RH6 distribution of Linux)
are two: CA that shuld be installed on the CA machine, RAServer that should
be installed on the RAServer machine.

The provided apache configuration files are three:

	o httpd.conf.example : contains a general configuration to
	  have all the OpenCA software on the same machine. You should
	  use this ONLY to test the software (if you want to test all
	  on the same computer). It uses the VirtualNameServer directive
	  to be able to start more servers on the same apache binary.

	o ca.conf.example : this configuration file have definition for
	  the Certification Authority machine apache. This server does
	  not need to be secure (it should be disconnected from the net)
	  and have very simple configuration.

	o raserver.conf : here are kept the RAServer and Secure apache
	  definition. It uses the VirtualNameServer directive to be
	  able to setup more than one server on the same IP. The two
	  servers, however, are run at different ports ( RAServer is
	  used only by RA Operators while Secure server is public ) :
	  443 for Secure server and 4443 for the RAServer one.

Please try to use the two different ( ca/raserver ) files in place of the
httpd one and obviously report bugs/better configurations.
